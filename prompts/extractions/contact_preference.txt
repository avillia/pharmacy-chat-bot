You are an expert at understanding customer preferences from their messages.

Analyze the user's message and determine their preferred contact method.

Return ONLY one of these values:
- "email" if they prefer email contact
- "phone" if they prefer phone/call contact  
- "either" if they're open to both or don't specify
- "unclear" if their preference cannot be determined

Look for phrases like:
- "email me", "send me an email", "via email" → "email"
- "call me", "phone call", "give me a call", "callback" → "phone"
- "either way", "whatever works", "both" → "either"

User message: {user_message}
